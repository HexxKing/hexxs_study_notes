    - SO-DIMM (Small Outline Dual In-Ine Memory Module):
      - Function: SO-DIMMs are memory modules used for expanding a computer's random-access memory (RAM). RAM is volatile memory used by the system to store data that the CPU needs quick access to.
      - Physical Form: They are smaller and more compact than regular DIMMs (Dual In-Line Memory Modules) and are commonly used in laptops, all-in-one PCs, and small form factor systems.
      - Functionality: SO-DIMMs are primarily responsible for ensuring that the computer can handle multiple tasks simultaneously without slowing down, by providing temporary storage for data in use.
    - Hard Drives:
      - Function: Hard drives are traditional storage devices that use spinning platters to store data magnetically. They retain data even when the power is turned off.
      - Physical Form: They are typically larger in physical size and have moving parts.
      - Functionality: Hard drives are used for long-term storage of files, programs, and the operating system. They have larger capacities and are cost-effective but are generally slower in terms of data access compared to SSDs.
    - SSDs (Solid-State Drives):
      - Function: SSDs are storage devices that use flash memory to store data, offering faster access times and data transfer speeds compared to traditional hard drives.
      - Physical Form: They are more compact and have no moving parts.
      - Functionality: SSDs are also used for long-term storage like hard drives, but they provide much faster data access and transfer rates. They are more durable, consume less power, and are known for improving overall system performance due to their speed.

1. **What are the common options for biometric authentication available in laptops?**
    - Laptops often have options for biometric authentication like facial recognition or fingerprint readers.
    - Facial Recognition: This method involves using the laptop's built-in camera to scan and recognize the user's face. The system captures facial features, analyzes them, and matches them with stored data to authenticate the user's identity.
    - Fingerprint Readers: These scanners use a person's unique fingerprint patterns to verify their identity. Users place their finger on the fingerprint reader, which captures the fingerprint and compares it to the stored fingerprint data for authentication.
1. **What is NFC technology, and what purpose does it serve?**
    - NFC, which stands for Near Field Communication, is a technology integrated into laptops for specific functionalities aimed at enhancing security and convenience. NFC enables laptops to establish wireless communication with other devices or NFC-enabled elements within close proximity without the need for physical contact.
    - Weâ€™re also seeing NFC being used more and more with laptops. Itâ€™s a technology weâ€™ve been using for quite some time on our mobile devices. Now weâ€™re starting to see it integrated into our laptop systems. This allows us to transfer data or perform authentication to the device without physically touching the device. If youâ€™re in a store, and you paid during checkout with your phone or your watch, then you were using NFC.
    - This technology serves two primary purposes:
      - Data Transfer: NFC facilitates the quick and secure transfer of data between compatible devices, such as smartphones, speakers, or other NFC-enabled devices. Users can easily share information, files, or perform certain actions by bringing two NFC-enabled devices close together.
      - Authentication: NFC can be utilized for authentication purposes. For instance, it can enable secure access to certain systems or information without the need for traditional methods like passwords. This technology allows for secure verification or authentication procedures, enhancing security measures on laptops by ensuring that authorized individuals gain access without the need for physical contact or manual input of authentication credentials.
