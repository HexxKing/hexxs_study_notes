# ‚úçÔ∏è Notes on Getting Started on Kaggle
These notes have been taken from YouTube videos on Kaggle's channel
- [Kaggle Lingo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEJHyuWKd-s&ab_channel=Kaggle)
  - Kernels = Jupyter notebooks and raw Python/Markdown scripts
  - Kerneler = a bot that will write a kernels for any dataset that you upload
  - Cells = in notebooks, cells are editable blocks of text or code
  - Docker = types of containers (file systems) lets you run code written on Kaggle on your local computer
  - Commit = commiting code runs it from top to bottom and saves static version you can refer back to (like a save file in a video game)
  - Competition Types
    - Featured : the most competitive with the biggest prizes. Often hosted by corporations looking to improve their current approach.
    - Analytics : Not supervised machine learning. Designed to help nonprofits with tricky problems they're facing.
    - Research : More theoretical problems based on active areas of research (academic & industrial).
    - Getting Started : Designed to be your first or second competition.
    - Playground :  Especially interesting problems that are fun to solve or are seasonal competitions. 
  - InClass = Lets you host your own Kaggle competition. (They don't have to be for an actual class, thats just why it was started)
  - Leaderboard = The place where all the scores for entries to a specific competition are shown.
    - Public : THis is the one that you see during the competition
    - Private : You only see this after the competition ends. Usually scored on a different part of the data.
  - Shakeup = Changes in ranking when the private leaderboard is shown at the end of a competition. Usually people move down the ranks due to overfitting.
  - In the money = people at that rank will win money if they still have that rank on the private leaderboard after the shakeup
  - Leakage = When information about the target variable is accidentally included in the training data
    - ex : you're trying to predict if someone will get an illness but you don't remove information about whether someone was treated for that illness
  - Kaggle Progression System
    - Novice : There is a checklist of things to do to become a Contributor
    - Contributor : your votes count for awarding other people medals
    - Expert : you get ranked separately in three catagories: discussion, kernels and competitions
    - Master
    - Grandmaster
  - Medals = are awarded for having your content upvoted or being near/at the top of the leaderboard for competitions
