# ‚úçÔ∏è Notes for "Node.js"
- ### What is it?
  - Node.js¬Æ is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome‚Äôs V8 JavaScript engine.
  - Node.js is an event-based, non-blocking, asynchronous I/O runtime that uses Google‚Äôs V8 JavaScript engine and libuv library.
  - It‚Äôs a JavaScript runtime.

---

- ### Google Chrome's V8 JavaScript Engine
  - The V8 engine is the open-source JavaScript engine that runs in Google Chrome and other Chromium-based web browsers
  - It was designed with performance in mind and is responsible for compiling JavaScript directly to native machine code that your computer can execute.
  - Node programs are NOT executed in a browser. Ryan Dahl took the V8 engine and enhanced it with various features, such as a file system API, an HTTP library, and a number of operating system‚Äìrelated utility methods
  - This means that Node.js is a program we can use to execute JavaScript on our computers.

---

- ### Helpful Terminal Commands
  - $ `node file_name.js` to execute the file
  - $ `node -v` will show you the version of Node installed on your local machine.
  - $ `npm -v` to check which version of Node Package Manager is installed 
  - $ `npm init -y` will simply generate an empty npm project and auto-populate a package.json file in the same folder without going through an interactive process. The -y stands for yes.

- ### Node Package Manager (npm)
  - In addition to being the package manager for JavaScript, npm is also the world‚Äôs largest software registry. 
  - `node_modules` is where npm saves packages and any libraries that those packages depend on. The `node_modules` folder shouldn‚Äôt be checked in to version control, and can, in fact, be re-created at any time by running npm install ($ `npm i`) from within the project‚Äôs root.
  - inside the `package.json` file is all of the project's dependencies which will allow any developer anywhere to clone your project and use npm to install whatever packages it needs to run.
