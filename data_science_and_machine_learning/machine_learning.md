# ‚úçÔ∏è Notes on Machine Learning
- [How to Models Work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsH2ItlSqnU&list=PLqFaTIg4myu9-T-fat2zjC5HmTpSybNfa&index=2&ab_channel=Kaggle)
  - Key Points :
    - Define a model : What model would I like to use?
      - `my_model = ModelName()`
    - Fit a model : "training" a model - taking a model we have defined and applying it to our dataset and asking it start pulling out underlying patterns in the data
      - `my_model.fit(features, target)`
    - Make predictions : is what happens once we've built a model and we want to generalize it, or extend it or apply it to data it's never seen before. 
      - `my_model.predict(data)`
    - Validate our model : not covered in this lesson
  - Recap : 
    - Decision Trees are a type of model
    - The data used to fit the model is called the training data
    - Capturing patterns from data is called fitting or training the model
    - After the model has been fit, you can apply it to new data to make predictions
    - The point at the bottom where we make a prediction is called a leaf
