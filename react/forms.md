# ✍️ Notes for "Forms"
- Form elements naturally keep some internal state.
- It’s convenient to have a JavaScript function that handles the submission of the form and has access to the data that the user entered into the form. The standard way to achieve this is with a technique called *“controlled components”*.
  - The React component that renders a form also controls what happens in that form on subsequent user input. An input form element whose value is controlled by React in this way is called a *“controlled component”*.
