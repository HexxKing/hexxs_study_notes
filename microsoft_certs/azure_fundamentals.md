# ‚úçÔ∏è [Notes for Azure Fundamentals - Part 1](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/paths/az-900-describe-cloud-concepts/)
  - Describe the basic concepts of cloud computing:
    - It is the delivery of computing services over the internet, which is otherwise known as the cloud. 
    - Services include servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics and intelligence. 
    - You typically pay only for the cloud services you use which helps you lower operating costs, run your infrastructure more efficiently, and scale as your business needs change. 
    - Cloud computing is a way to rent compute power and storage from someone else's datacenter. 
  - Determine whether Azure is the right solution for your business needs:
    - Azure is a cloud computing platform with an ever-expanding set of services to help you build solutions to meet your business goals.
    - Azure gives you the freedom to build, manage and deploy apps on a massive global network using your favorite tools and frameworks. 
    - The Azure portal is a web-based, unified console that provides an alternative to command-line tools.
    - Azure Marketplace helps connect users with Microsoft partners, independent software vendors, and startups that are offering their solutions and services which are optimized to run on Azure.
  - Differentiate between the different methods of creating an Azure subscription:
    - You can manage your Azure subscription in the Azure portal. 
  - Azure Services:
    - Compute 
      - Azure provides a range of options for hosting applications and services.
      - Virtual Machines, VM Scale Sets, Kubernetes Service, Container Instances, Azure Functions
    - Networking
      - Linking compute resources and providing access to applications is the key function of Azure networking. 
      - It includes a range of options to connect the outside world to services and features in the global Azure datacenters.
      - Virtual Network, Load Balancer, Application Gateway, VPN Gateway, DNS, Content Delivery Network, DDos Protection, Traffic Manager, Network Watcher, Firewall, Virtual WAN
    - Storage
      - Durable and highly available with redundancy and replication.
      - Secure through automatic encryption and role-based access control.
      - Scalable with virtually unlimited storage 
      - Managed, handling maintenance and any critical problem for you
      - Accessible from anywhere in the world over HTTP or HTTPS
      - Azure provides four main types of storage services. 
        - Blob storage: for very large objects, such as video files or bitmaps.
        - File storage: for file shares that can be accessed and managed like a file server. 
        - Queue storage: a data store for queuing and reliably delivering messages between applications. 
        - Table storage: a service that stores non-relational structured data (AKA No SQL data) in the cloud, providing a key/attribute store with a schemaless design.
    - Mobile
      - Devs can create mobile back-end services for iOS, Android and Windows apps quickly and easily. 
      - Offline data synchronization
      - Connectivity to on-premises data
      - broadcasting push notifications
      - autoscaling to match business needs
    - Databases
      - Azure provides multiple database services to store a wide variety of data types and volumes. 
      - With global connectivity, this data is available to users instantly. 
      - Cosmos DB, SQL, MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server on Azure Virtual Machines, Synapse Analytics, Migration Service, Cache for Redis, MariaDB
    - Web
      - Azure includes first-class support to build and host web aps and HTTP-based web services. 
      - App Service, Notification Hubs, API Managment, Cognitive Search, Web Apps feature of Azure App Service, Azure SignalR Service
    - Internet of Things
      - The ability for devices to garner and then relay information for data analysis is referred to as IoT. 
      - Many services can assist and drive end-to-end solutions for IoT on Azure. 
      - IoT Central, IoT Hub, IoT Edge
    - Big data
      - Open-source cluster technologies have been developed to deal with large data sets. 
      - Azure supports a broad range of technologies and services to provide big data and analytic solutions.
      - Synapse Analytics, HDInsight, Databricks
    - AI
      - AI, in the context of cloud computing, is based around a broad range of services, the core of which is machine learning. 
      - Using Machine Learning, computers learn without being explicitly programmed. 
      - Machine Learning Service, ML Studio
      - A closely related set of products are the cognitive services. They can be prebuilt APIs in your applications to solve complex problems. 
        - Vision, Speech, Knowledge mapping, Bing Search, Natural Language Processing
    - DevOps
      -
