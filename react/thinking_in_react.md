# ✍️ Notes for "Thinking in React"
One of the many great parts of React is how it makes you think about apps as you build them. 

### Step 1: Break The UI Into A Component Hierarchy
-  The first thing you’ll want to do is to draw boxes around every component (and subcomponent) in the mock and give them all names.
  - If you’re working with a designer, they may have already done this, so go talk to them! Their Photoshop layer names may end up being the names of your React components!
- But how do you know what should be its own component?
  - *single responsibility principle* = a component should only do one thing. If it ends up growing, it should be decomposed into smaller subcomponents.
